## What this pack gives you

- 4 standalone game starter projects
- 1 bonus isometric sprite workflow repo
- 8 battle-tested agent skills for game development — works with Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor
- 3 beginner-friendly full tutorial videos for both 2D and 3D workflows, and my general approach to gamedev

This pack is designed for builders who want to move quickly during a jam without starting from a blank folder.

If you want the broader ecosystem of projects, writeups, workflows, and whatever I’m building next, go to [vibegamedev.com](https://vibegamedev.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=vibejam-starter-pack-mid).

---

## Start here

1. Download this repo or ZIP it.
2. Open the repo root in Claude Code or your agent tool of choice.
3. Read [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md).
4. Watch the beginner-friendly 2D and 3D videos for a full walkthrough of how to use these skills and workflows.
5. Pick one lane:
   - 2D Phaser
   - 3D Three.js
   - bonus asset workflow
6. Copy a starter into a new working repo if you want a clean jam project.

Important: open the repo root, not just a single project folder, if you want the shared skills to be visible to your agent.

## Pick your lane

| Lane | Folder | Best for | Run locally |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2D platformer | `projects/oakwoods/` | movement, combat, parallax, Phaser + Vite | `npm install && npm run dev` |
| 2D tactics prototype | `projects/tinyswords/` | tilemaps, layered UI, turn-based ideas | serve/open `public/index.html` |
| 3D arena shooter | `projects/toonshooter/` | Three.js scene building, GLTF workflows, action prototypes | `serve public` then open `/toonshooter/` |
| 3D mini-game | `projects/forest-census/` | compact Three.js game loops, asset manifests, static deploy flow | `serve public` then open `/forest/` |
| Bonus sprite workflow | `bonus/vibe-isometric-sprites/` | isometric sprite prompting + fal.ai image workflow ideas | browse the prompts + shared skill |

Notes:
- `oakwoods` requires the external Oak Woods art pack. See that project’s README for asset setup.
- Pirate 3D iOS is intentionally not included as a project in this pack.
- The reusable `threejs-capacitor-ios` skill is included at the root for builders who want the iOS export workflow.

## Unified skills included

This pack dedupes the most reusable skills into one shared root.

### Claude Code
- `.claude/skills/phaser-gamedev/`
- `.claude/skills/phaser4-gamedev/`
- `.claude/skills/playwright-testing/`
- `.claude/skills/threejs-builder/`
- `.claude/skills/tinyswords-tilemap/`
- `.claude/skills/threejs-capacitor-ios/`
- `.claude/skills/fal-ai-image/`
- `.claude/skills/retro-diffusion/`

### Agent-compatible
- `.agents/skills/phaser-gamedev/`
- `.agents/skills/phaser4-gamedev/`
- `.agents/skills/playwright-testing/`
- `.agents/skills/threejs-builder/`
- `.agents/skills/tinyswords-tilemap/`
- `.agents/skills/threejs-capacitor-ios/`
- `.agents/skills/fal-ai-image/`
- `.agents/skills/retro-diffusion/`

Why this matters:
- no duplicated skill folders hidden inside every project
- one place to update the shared workflows
- easier to browse what your agent can actually use
- cleaner zip for a lead magnet or jam download

## Repo layout

```text
vibejam-starter-pack/
├─ README.md
├─ START-HERE.md
├─ assets/
│  └─ vgd.png
├─ .claude/
│  └─ skills/
├─ .agents/
│  └─ skills/
├─ projects/
│  ├─ oakwoods/
│  ├─ tinyswords/
│  ├─ toonshooter/
│  └─ forest-census/
└─ bonus/
   └─ vibe-isometric-sprites/
```

Each project folder is kept standalone on purpose.

That means you can:
- inspect the original project structure
- copy one starter out into its own repo
- keep the shared agent skills at the root

## Why this pack is useful during a jam

Most jam packs are either:
- too abstract to be useful, or
- too messy to trust under time pressure.

This one is built around real repos that already proved useful publicly.

You get examples for:
- 2D Phaser architecture (Phaser 3 + Phaser 4 migration)
- Three.js static game deployment
- GLTF asset pipelines
- Playwright/canvas testing patterns
- Tiny Swords tilemap layering
- iOS export workflow skills for Three.js + Capacitor
- prompt/process inspiration from the isometric sprite bonus repo
- a reusable fal.ai image-generation skill for sprite workflow experimentation
- a Retro Diffusion pixel-art skill for spritesheets, walk cycles, and animation workflows
