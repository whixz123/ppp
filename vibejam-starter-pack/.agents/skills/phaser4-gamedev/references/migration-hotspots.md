# Phaser 3 to 4 Migration Hotspots

Use this reference before touching a Phaser 3 codebase. The first pass is not implementation; it is search, classification, and scope control.

## Migration Philosophy

Do not treat migration as a flat rename exercise.

Split findings into three buckets:

1. **Usually mechanical**: straightforward API updates
2. **Behavioral review required**: code may compile but behave differently
3. **Architectural rewrite**: the underlying renderer or feature model changed

This prevents wasting time hand-editing easy cases while missing the renderer-level risks.

## First Search Pass

Run searches for these symbols early:

- `setTintFill`
- `tintFill`
- `BitmapMask`
- `GeometryMask`
- `preFX`
- `postFX`
- `ColorMatrix`
- `Phaser.Geom.Point`
- `Point.`
- `Math.TAU`
- `Math.PI2`
- `setPipeline('Light2D')`
- `setPipeline("Light2D")`
- `DynamicTexture`
- `RenderTexture`
- `TileSprite`
- `Shader`
- `gl.`
- `Pipeline`
- `WebGLRenderer`

## Mechanical Replacements

| Phaser 3 | Phaser 4 |
|----------|----------|
| `setTintFill(color)` | `setTint(color).setTintMode(Phaser.TintModes.FILL)` |
| `Math.PI2` | `Math.TAU` |
| `setPipeline('Light2D')` | `setLighting(true)` |
| `Phaser.Struct.Set` | native `Set` |
| `Phaser.Struct.Map` | native `Map` |

These are good codemod candidates, but still review call sites for behavior assumptions.

## Behavioral Review Required

### `Math.TAU`

In Phaser 3, `Math.TAU` effectively matched `PI / 2`.  
In Phaser 4, `Math.TAU` is actual tau: `PI * 2`.

If old code used `TAU` for quarter turns, replace it with `Math.PI_OVER_2`.

### `ColorMatrix`

Color methods moved under the `colorMatrix` property.

```ts
// old
colorMatrix.sepia();

// new
colorMatrix.colorMatrix.sepia();
```

### `DynamicTexture` and `RenderTexture`

Buffered drawing now requires explicit `render()` execution. If a ported effect appears blank or stale, check whether the commands are queued but never rendered.

### `TileSprite`

Texture cropping support is gone. If the old implementation depended on cropped repetition, redesign it instead of trying to force the old pattern back in.

### Camera Internals

Standard camera properties usually port cleanly. Direct matrix work does not. Any code that reads or mutates camera matrices needs a focused review.

## Architectural Rewrite Areas

### FX and Masks

Phaser 4 unifies FX and masks into filters.

- `BitmapMask` is removed in WebGL paths.
- `preFX` and `postFX` assumptions no longer apply.
- Some old FX are now actions or new game objects.

If a scene relies on layered masking, post-processing, or filter order, plan dedicated time for it.

### Custom Pipelines and Renderer Internals

Phaser 4 replaces the v3 pipeline model with render nodes. If the project touched custom pipelines, internal renderer buffers, or direct WebGL state, expect redesign work rather than patching.

### Shaders and Texture Orientation

Phaser 4 uses GL-style texture orientation. Custom shader work must be re-checked with that assumption. Compressed textures may need to be regenerated with the correct Y-axis orientation.

## Recommended Migration Order

1. Update package version and type surfaces.
2. Fix obvious compile errors from removed APIs.
3. Audit renderer, filter, shader, lighting, and texture workflows.
4. Re-test visuals before optimizing performance.
5. Only then consider GPU-layer upgrades or visual enhancements.

## What Not to Do

- Do not rewrite everything before classifying the migration risks.
- Do not assume passing TypeScript means rendering is correct.
- Do not debug masks, shaders, and compressed textures as if Phaser 3 internals still apply.
