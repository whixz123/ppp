# Start Here

If you only read one file before building, read this one.

This repo is a curated Vibe Jam starter pack:
- real starter projects
- shared Claude Code / agent skills at the repo root
- a bonus sprite workflow repo for visual pipeline ideas

If you want the full ecosystem beyond this pack, go to [vibegamedev.com](https://vibegamedev.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=start-here&utm_campaign=vibejam-starter-pack).

## The important rule

Open the repo root in Claude Code or your agent tool of choice.

Why:
- the shared skills live in `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`
- if you only open a single subfolder, your agent may miss the unified skill set

---

## Fastest way to use this pack

Before doing anything else, watch the 2D and 3D tutorial videos in this repo for a full walkthrough of how to use these skills and workflows.

### Option 1 — Jam fast
1. Pick one starter from `projects/`
2. Copy it into a brand new repo/folder for your jam entry
3. Keep this pack open separately as your reference + skills workspace

### Option 2 — Explore first
1. Read the root `README.md`
2. Open one project README
3. Browse the shared skills
4. Decide which lane matches your idea

## Which starter should you use?

### Use `projects/oakwoods/` if you want…
- a 2D platformer base
- Phaser + Vite + TypeScript
- movement, jump, attack, parallax

Local run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Important: this project expects the Oak Woods art pack. Check `projects/oakwoods/README.md`.

---

### Use `projects/tinyswords/` if you want…
- a 2D tactics / strategy prototype
- layered tilemaps and stylized UI
- Tiny Swords asset workflow ideas

Local run:
- open `projects/tinyswords/public/index.html`
- or serve that folder locally

Best skills to pair with it:
- `phaser-gamedev`
- `tinyswords-tilemap`
- `playwright-testing`

---

### Use `projects/toonshooter/` if you want…
- a 3D action prototype
- Three.js scene composition
- GLTF-heavy workflow examples

Local run:
```bash
serve public
```
Then open `/toonshooter/`.

Best skill to pair with it:
- `threejs-builder`

---

### Use `projects/forest-census/` if you want…
- a tiny 3D mini-game starter
- static deployable Three.js structure
- a compact asset-manifest workflow

Local run:
```bash
serve public
```
Then open `/forest/`.

Best skill to pair with it:
- `threejs-builder`

---

### Use `bonus/vibe-isometric-sprites/` if you want…
- prompt ideas for isometric art pipelines
- a lightweight bonus workflow folder for art-direction inspiration
- the shared `fal-ai-image` skill at the repo root

This one is best treated as a reference folder, not your main gameplay starter.

---

## Shared skills in this pack

Both Claude and agent-compatible workflows get:
- `phaser-gamedev`
- `playwright-testing`
- `threejs-builder`
- `tinyswords-tilemap`
- `threejs-capacitor-ios`
- `fal-ai-image`
- `retro-diffusion`

## Recommended first moves

### If your idea is 2D
Start with `oakwoods` for movement/action or `tinyswords` for tactics/UI.

### If your idea is 3D
Start with `toonshooter` if you want something action-oriented.
Start with `forest-census` if you want a smaller, cleaner base.

### If your idea depends on visual style
Browse `bonus/vibe-isometric-sprites/` for prompt/process inspiration.
